# github-deploy

**One-click GitHub Pages deployment for HTML files.**

## Goal

github-deploy eliminates deployment friction. Point it at HTML files and it handles everything: repo creation, Pages configuration, custom domain, search engine blocking, and HTTPS enforcement. Result: live site at works.jasonnamii.com with zero manual configuration.

## When & How to Use

Trigger when you have HTML files ready to publish. Creates private repo, configures Pages, binds domain, sets up robots.txt + noindex, enables HTTPS in one step.

## Use Cases

| Scenario | Prompt | What Happens |
|---|---|---|
| Deploy single HTML | `"Deploy this dashboard to works.jasonnamii.com."` | Create private repo→push→enable Pages→domain→privacy→HTTPS→live |
| Deploy portfolio | `"Deploy 5 design comps as portfolio."` | Create repo→push all→Pages→domain→privacy→HTTPS→live |
| Update deployment | `"Redeploy with new version."` | Push updates→Pages auto-rebuilds→site updates |

## Key Features

- One-click deployment — no manual repo/branch/Pages setup
- Private repo by default
- Search engine blocking: robots.txt + meta noindex
- Custom domain auto-binding (works.jasonnamii.com)
